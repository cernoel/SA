Software Architecture 2018/19 WS

VO/KU

This course highlights the importance of developing a software architecture for complex software systems. The course focuses on investigating properties of proven software architectures and involves students in applying those architectures in a software project.

Warning: This project is more or less a chaotic bunch of lines of code, because it's our first attempt in techniques we were using, but it migth be (somehow) a usefull sneek and peek for someone, who has "schdraggl" with his life in this couse. Have fun!
